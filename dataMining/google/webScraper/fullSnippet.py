@author - Eric Kingori
@Discription - this program will extract a full snippet from the link given the original snippet and link
@limitations - This program cannot extract snippets from pdfs, word documents, powerpointslides and etc
@limitations - If the snippet contains majority or all of the information it will return the original snippet
@output - If succesful it will return the entire sentence or lines where the original snippet was found, if
unsuccesful it returns the original snippet
